      AmeriCorps is a federal program in the United States that engages
      individuals in public service to address critical community needs, such as
      education, disaster response, environmental conservation, and poverty
      alleviation. Established in 1993, it operates under the Corporation for
      National and Community Service (CNCS), offering opportunities for
      participants, known as AmeriCorps members, to work with nonprofits,
      schools, and community organizations. Members commit to a term of service,
      during which they receive a stipend, professional development, and an
      education award that can be used to pay for college or repay student
      loans. AmeriCorps fosters civic engagement and aims to strengthen
      communities through volunteerism and capacity building.
